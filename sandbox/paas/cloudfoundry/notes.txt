###ÊInstructions

Assume vmc is installed on deploying machine, as per:

    http://start.cloudfoundry.com/tools/vmc/installing-vmc.html

Currently assumes vmc and configured (targetted and logged in).

Currently supports java_web, will create apps and deploy (and redeploy) WAR files.


###ÊEnhancements

* use REST API (java bindings or perhaps jruby?)
* take target host and credentials from config
* parse "cloudfoundry" (to use api.cloudfoundry.com) and "cloudfoundry:custom.hostname.org"
* support declaring service bindings
* support other frameworks (besides java_web)
* support vanilla installation of cloudfoundry on bare metal machines
